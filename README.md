# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis & Prediction

**Survival Prediction and Statistical Analysis of Titanic Dataset Using Machine Learning and Hypothesis Testing**  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and logistic regression modeling on the classic [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/titanic/data).  
This project combines statistical insight and data storytelling with machine learning to predict passenger survival and explain underlying factors.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular introductory datasets for data science and machine learning.  
In this project, we aim to:
- Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing** (handle missing values, outliers, normalization).
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to find patterns and correlations.
- Apply **Hypothesis Testing** and **A/B Testing** to statistically validate assumptions.
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model to predict passenger survival.
- Present results visually and analytically in an **IEEE-style research paper**.
